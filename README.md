# bigKRLS
Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) is a kernel-based, complexity-penalized method developed by [Hainmueller and Hazlett (2013)](http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/2/143), and designed to minimize parametric assumptions while maintaining interpretive clarity. Here, we introduce *bigKRLS*, an updated version of the original [KRLS R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KRLS/index.html) with algorithmic and implementation improvements designed to optimize speed and memory usage. These improvements allow users to straightforwardly fit KRLS models to medium and large datasets (N > ~2500). 

# Major Updates

1. C++ integration. We re-implement most major computations in the model in C++ via [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) and [RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppArmadillo/index.html). These changes produce up to a 50% runtime decrease compared to the original R implementation.

2. Leaner algorithm. Because of the Tikhonov regularization and parameter tuning strategies used in KRLS, the method of estimation is inherently memory-heavy (O(N<sup>2</sup>)), making memory savings important even in small- and medium-sized applications. We develop and implement a [new local derivatives algorithm](https://github.com/rdrr1990/code/blob/master/mohanty_shaffer_IMC.pdf), which reduces peak memory usage by approximately an order of magnitude, and cut the number of computations needed to find regularization parameter [in half](https://github.com/rdrr1990/code/blob/master/solveforc.pdf).

3. Improved memory management. Most data objects in R perform poorly in memory-intensive applications. We use a series of packages in the [bigmemory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/index.html) environment to ease this constraint, allowing our implementation to handle larger datasets more smoothly.

4. Greater customization. For large models with many nuisance parameters (e.g. dummy variables for all 50 US states), not all coefficients may be of interest. We allow users to estimate pairwise marginal derivatives for a subset of variables if desired, reducing runtime substantially.

5. Interactive data visualization. We've designed an R [Shiny](shiny.rstudio.com) app that allows users bigKRLS users to easily share results with collaborators or more general audiences. Simply call shiny.bigKRLS() on the outputted regression object.

# Installation
bigKRLS is under active development, and currently requires R version 3.3.0 or later. Windows users should use RTools 3.3 or later; Windows users should use R (not RStudio). To install, use standard devtools syntax:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('rdrr1990/bigKRLS')
```

## Dependencies
bigKRLS requires Rcpp and RcppArmadillo, as well as a series of packages in the bigmemory environment. Users new to these packages may wish see our [installation notes](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwZXRlbW9oYW50eXxneDozYTA1ZGRjZmJkZWY0YWI4).
